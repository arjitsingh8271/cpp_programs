Operator
-> An operator is a symbol that operates on a value to perform specific mathematical or logical computations. They form the foundation of any programming language.

Types of Operators in C++:

	Binary Operators: Must have two operants.
		1. Arithmetic Operator	(+, -, *, /, %)				eg: a + b
		2. Relational Operator	(<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=)		eg: a < b
			OR Comparision Operator
		3. Logical Operator		(&&, ||, !)					eg: a && b
		4. Bitwise Operator		(&, |, <<, >>, ~, ^)		eg: a & b
		5. Assignment Operator	(+=, -=, *=, /=, %=)		eg: a += b


	Unary Operators: Have only one operant.
		6. Increment Operator		(++)	eg: ++a and a++
		7. Decriment Operator		(--)	eg: --a and a--
			prefixes (++a and --b)
			postfix (a++ and b--)


	8. Ternary Operator: also called  Condition operator
	(?:)	eg: (condition_statment) ? condition_true : condition_false;
